// Comparig Bubble , Selection and Insertion Sort

//for all in worst case we have O(n^2) in time and O(1) in space
//quadratic sorting algorithms

// only differ when we have almost sorted data
// in those case bubble and insertion do well

//plus in these types of sorting algos is that they dont use any extra space ***


//insetions is great when you have new data and have to do more than once
// --maintan sorted data base
// these exec when the data sets are small
